# Estimating COV-19 infection rates in Finland

## Disclaimer

This script was created to pseudoscientifically prove that we are all doomed
and should prepare for the coming apocalypse. Or just as an interesting
experiment in playing with a nice calculator app.

The author has no training in math, statistics or medical research and is
therefore TOTALLY qualified to make wild predictions on the internet just like
everyone else.

## How the equation is generated

The equation is generated simply by entering the infection rates to a HP Prime
Pro calculator simulator using the "Statistics 2Var" application.
The first column is day number 1..N (Day 1 is 2020-02-26) and the second column
is the number of confirmed cases for that day.
The app generates an equation closest to the date, which is used by this script
to generate the estimates.
